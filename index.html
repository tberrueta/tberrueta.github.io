<h2>Latest News</h2>

  <p style="font-size: 70%">Please check out my latest publication in <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/371/6524/90">Science Magazine</a>! It is the culmination of years of hard work from myself and colleagues at MIT and Georgia Tech. In this work, we introduce and validate <u>rattling theory</u>, which describes the emergence of order and self-organization in a broad class of complex systems.

  <br><br>If you're interested in a high-level discussion of the work, I was interviewed by <a href="https://gizmodo.com/meet-the-pint-sized-robots-that-spontaneously-dance-1845969214">Gizmodo</a> about it. If you're interested in a more in-depth discussion of the main findings of the paper, check out this seminar talk I gave about the work:

<h2>About Me</h2>

  <p style="font-size: 70%">I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Northwestern University <a href="https://robotics.northwestern.edu/">Center for Robotics and Biosystems</a>. I am a member of the <a href="https://murpheylab.github.io/">Interactive and Emergent Autonomy Laboratory</a>, and am advised by <a href="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/profiles/murphey-todd.html">Dr. Todd D. Murphey</a>. I received my B.S. in Engineering from <a href="https://www.hmc.edu/">Harvey Mudd College</a> in 2017 and my M.S. in Mechanical Engineering from  <a href="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/mechanical/">Northwestern University</a> in 2020.

  <br><br>I study complex robotic systems and their emergent behaviors. I develop algorithms for identifying and controlling emergence to achieve challenging objectives. My research is at the intersection of robotics, machine learning, information theory, and statistical physics.
