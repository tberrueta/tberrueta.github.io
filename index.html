  <p style="font-size: 70%">My latest research is now out at <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-33396-5">Nature Communications</a>!. In this collaboration with chemical engineers at the Strano Research group in MIT, I make use of the physics of self-organization to enable sophisticated capabilities in a simple collective of active colloidal particles. Making use of my previous work on <a href="https://gizmodo.com/meet-the-pint-sized-robots-that-spontaneously-dance-1845969214">rattling theory</a>, I discovered a thermodynamic mechanism for asymmetry-induced order in systems with strongly-interacting degrees of freedom. We exploited this mechanism in the design of our microparticle collective to enable emergent periodic current generation directly on-board the particles, whose potential task-capability we demonstrated by powering state-of-the-art microrobotic arms. Feel free to check out the video overview below:

  <p style="font-size: 70%">I am also proud to announce that <a href="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/news/articles/2022/06/two-graduate-students-receive-presidential-fellowships/"><u>I am a recipient of the Presidential Fellowship</u></a>! The highest honor bestowed to a graduate student by Northwestern University. In part, this award is in recognition of a distinguished record of scholarly excellence as established through publications, such as my work on rattling theory published in <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abc6182">Science</a> and my work on emergence in robot collectives published in <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/scirobotics.aax4316">Science Robotics</a>.

<h2>About Me</h2>

  <p style="font-size: 70%">I am a Ph.D. candidate and Presidential Fellow at the Northwestern University <a href="https://robotics.northwestern.edu/">Center for Robotics and Biosystems</a>. I am a member of the <a href="https://murpheylab.github.io/">Interactive and Emergent Autonomy Laboratory</a>, and am advised by <a href="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/profiles/murphey-todd.html">Dr. Todd D. Murphey</a>. I received my B.S. in Engineering fromHarvey Mudd College in 2017 and my M.S. in Mechanical Engineering from Northwestern University in 2020.

  <br><br>I am an interdisciplinary scientist and engineer focusing on understanding and controlling complex robotic systems. From termite construction to the molecular machinery of cells, emergent behaviors in nature stand as proof that collections of simple elements can become greater than the sum of their parts. Biological systems of this kind are often noisy, chaotic, and unpredictable â€” yet no human-made machine rivals their capabilities. Bringing together insights from artificial intelligence, statistical physics, and chemical engineering, I seek to make engineered systems more <i>life-like</i> by embracing randomness and uncertainty.
