<h2>Latest News</h2>

  <p style="font-size: 70%">Excited to announce that I have stepped up as Team Lead for Caltech Racer's <a href="https://www.indyautonomouschallenge.com/">Indy Autonomous Challenge</a> team. This is a full sized autonomous IndyNXT racecar capable of reaching speeds exceeding 155 mph that we have been using as a research platform. In addition to leading the design of the car's control systems, as lead I am now responsible with managing the project and pushing the team towards cool research ideas on multiple fronts. You can find some coverage in anticipation of an upcoming race in <a href="https://magazine.caltech.edu/post/computer-start-your-engine">Caltech Magazine</a>. The video below shows a fully autonomous lap at the legendary Laguna Seca Raceway, where our race will take place.

    <br>Also, in collaboration with my colleague Allison Pinosky, I will be presenting some <a href="https://tberrueta.github.io/assets/pdfs/PinoskyCASE2025.pdf">recent work</a> at the <i>IEEE Conference on Automation Science and Engineering (CASE)</i> on what it takes to make reinforcement algorithms learn from scratch in real-time on hardware. This work is an extension of my reinforcement learning work published in <i>Nature Machine Intelligence</i>, where I introduced a novel framework called <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-024-00829-3">MaxDiff RL</a>.

<h2>About Me</h2>

  <p style="font-size: 70%"> I am an interdisciplinary roboticist interested in exploring how physics can inform and complicate robot learning. I combine insights from optimal control, reinforcement learning, and statistical physics to develop reliable real-time autonomy for hardware systems.

  <br><br>I am a Postdoctoral Scholar at the California Institute of Technology in the Autonomous Robotics and Control Lab, where I am advised by Profs. <a href="https://aerospacerobotics.caltech.edu/">Soon-Jo Chung</a> and Fred Hadaegh. I received a Ph.D. and M.S. in Mechanical Engineering from Northwestern University in 2024, where I was a <a href="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/news/articles/2022/06/two-graduate-students-receive-presidential-fellowships/">Presidential Fellow</a> under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://murpheylab.github.io/">Todd Murphey</a>. I also received a B.S. in Engineering from Harvey Mudd College in 2017.
