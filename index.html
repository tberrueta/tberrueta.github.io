<h2>About</h2>

<body>
  <p style="font-size: 70%">I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Northwestern University <a href="https://robotics.northwestern.edu/">Center for Robotics and Biosystems</a>. I am a member of the <a href="https://murpheylab.github.io/">Interactive and Emergent Autonomy Laboratory</a>, and advised by <a href="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/profiles/murphey-todd.html">Todd D. Murphey</a>.

  <br><br>I am interested in the study of complex, often multi-agent, robotic systems and their emergent behaviors. I focus on the development of algorithmic tools for learning to identify and control such emergent behavior in order to harness it towards achieving challenging objectives. My research is at the intersection of robotics, machine learning, information theory, and statistical physics.

  <br><br>I recieved my B.S. in Engineering from the <a href="https://www.hmc.edu/">Harvey Mudd College</a>
  in 2017 and my M.S. in Mechanical Engineering from  <a href="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/mechanical/">Northwestern University</a> in 2020.
