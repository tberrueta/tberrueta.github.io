  <p style="font-size: 70%">I am proud to announce that <u>I am a recipient of the Presidential Fellowship</u>! The highest honor bestowed to a graduate student by Northwestern University. In part, this award is in recognition of a distinguished record of scholarly excellence as established through publications such as my work on rattling theory published in <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abc6182">Science Magazine</a>. If you're interested in learning more about this work, I presented it at a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oftFOybQUUo">seminar</a>, and was also interviewed by <a href="https://gizmodo.com/meet-the-pint-sized-robots-that-spontaneously-dance-1845969214">Gizmodo</a> about it.

<h2>About Me</h2>

  <p style="font-size: 70%">I am a Ph.D. candidate and Presidential Fellow at the Northwestern University <a href="https://robotics.northwestern.edu/">Center for Robotics and Biosystems</a>. I am a member of the <a href="https://murpheylab.github.io/">Interactive and Emergent Autonomy Laboratory</a>, and am advised by <a href="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/profiles/murphey-todd.html">Dr. Todd D. Murphey</a>. I received my B.S. in Engineering from <a href="https://www.hmc.edu/">Harvey Mudd College</a> in 2017 and my M.S. in Mechanical Engineering from  <a href="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/mechanical/">Northwestern University</a> in 2020.

  <br><br>I am an interdisciplinary scientist and engineer focusing on understanding and controlling complex robotic systems. From termite construction to the molecular machinery of cells, emergent behaviors in nature stand as proof that collections of simple elements can become greater than the sum of their parts. Biological systems of this kind are often noisy, chaotic, and unpredictable â€” yet no human-made machine rivals their capabilities. Bringing together insights from artificial intelligence, statistical physics, and chemical engineering, I seek to make engineered systems more <i>life-like</i> by embracing randomness and uncertainty.
