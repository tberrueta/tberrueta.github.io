<h2>About Me</h2>

<body>
  <p style="font-size: 70%">I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Northwestern University <a href="https://robotics.northwestern.edu/">Center for Robotics and Biosystems</a>. I am a member of the <a href="https://murpheylab.github.io/">Interactive and Emergent Autonomy Laboratory</a>, and am advised by <a href="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/profiles/murphey-todd.html">Dr. Todd D. Murphey</a>. I recieved my B.S. in Engineering from <a href="https://www.hmc.edu/">Harvey Mudd College</a> in 2017 and my M.S. in Mechanical Engineering from  <a href="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/mechanical/">Northwestern University</a> in 2020.

  <br><br>I am interested in the study of complex, often multi-agent, robotic systems and their emergent behaviors. I focus on the development of algorithmic tools for learning to identify and control such emergent behavior in order to harness it towards achieving challenging objectives. My research is at the intersection of robotics, machine learning, information theory, and statistical physics.

  <br><br>Lately I've been focusing on the understanding and controlling the behavior of swarms of smarticles:
