  <p style="font-size: 70%">After many years of work, I'm very excited to release our preprint on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15293">Maximum Diffusion Reinforcement Learning</a>. MaxDiff RL is a generalization of the popular MaxEnt RL framework, rebuilt from the ground up to take into account the physical properties of embodied agents into account during decision-making. MaxDiff RL agents are also provably guaranteed to exhibit seed-invariant performance and to be capable of single-shot learning in a broad class of problem settings. Separately, I recently published a <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/aisy.202300111">perspective piece</a>  in Advanced Intelligent Systems on the future of soft matter design, learning, and control across scales in collaboration with <a href="https://sites.northwestern.edu/roboticmatterlab/">Dr. Ryan Truby</a>. Check out one of our MaxDiff RL paper videos:

  <p style="font-size: 70%">Recently, I published an article in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-33396-5">Nature Communications</a>. I was also interviewed by the <a href="https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2022/10/chemistry-flexes-microrobotic-arm/">Northwestern News</a> team about the work. In this collaboration with chemical engineers at the Strano Research Group in MIT, I make use of the physics of self-organization to enable sophisticated capabilities in a simple collective of active colloidal particles. Making use of my previous work on <a href="https://gizmodo.com/meet-the-pint-sized-robots-that-spontaneously-dance-1845969214">rattling theory</a>, I discovered a thermodynamic mechanism for asymmetry-induced order in strongly-interacting systems. We exploited this mechanism in designing our microparticle collective to enable emergent periodic currents directly on-board the particles, which we demonstrated by powering state-of-the-art microrobotic arms. Check out the video overview:

  <p style="font-size: 70%">I am also proud to have recently become <a href="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/news/articles/2022/06/two-graduate-students-receive-presidential-fellowships/"><u>a recipient of the Presidential Fellowship</u></a>! The highest honor bestowed to a graduate student by Northwestern University. In part, this award is in recognition of a distinguished record of scholarly excellence as established through publications, such as my work on rattling theory published in <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abc6182">Science</a> and my work on emergence in robot collectives published in <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/scirobotics.aax4316">Science Robotics</a>.

<h2>About Me</h2>

  <p style="font-size: 70%">I am a Ph.D. candidate and Presidential Fellow at the Northwestern University <a href="https://robotics.northwestern.edu/">Center for Robotics and Biosystems</a>. I am a member of the <a href="https://murpheylab.github.io/">Interactive and Emergent Autonomy Laboratory</a>, and am advised by <a href="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/profiles/murphey-todd.html">Dr. Todd D. Murphey</a>. I received my B.S. in Engineering from Harvey Mudd College in 2017 and my M.S. in Mechanical Engineering from Northwestern University in 2020.

  <br><br>I am an interdisciplinary scientist and engineer focusing on understanding and controlling complex robotic systems. From termite construction to the molecular machinery of cells, emergent behaviors in nature stand as proof that collections of simple elements can become greater than the sum of their parts. Biological systems of this kind are often noisy, chaotic, and unpredictable â€” yet no human-made machine rivals their capabilities. Bringing together insights from artificial intelligence, statistical physics, and chemical engineering, I seek to make engineered systems more <i>life-like</i> by embracing randomness and uncertainty.
