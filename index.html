<h2>About Me</h2>

<body>
  <p style="font-size: 70%">I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Northwestern University <a href="https://robotics.northwestern.edu/">Center for Robotics and Biosystems</a>. I am a member of the <a href="https://murpheylab.github.io/">Interactive and Emergent Autonomy Laboratory</a>, and am advised by <a href="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/profiles/murphey-todd.html">Dr. Todd D. Murphey</a>. I recieved my B.S. in Engineering from <a href="https://www.hmc.edu/">Harvey Mudd College</a> in 2017 and my M.S. in Mechanical Engineering from  <a href="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/mechanical/">Northwestern University</a> in 2020.

  <br><br>I study complex robotic systems and their emergent behaviors. I develop algorithms for identifying and controlling emergence to achieve challenging objectives. My research is at the intersection of robotics, machine learning, information theory, and statistical physics.

  <br><br>Lately I've been focusing on understanding and controlling the behavior of swarms of smarticles:
