  <p style="font-size: 70%">Please check out my latest publication in <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/371/6524/90">Science Magazine</a>! It is the culmination of years of hard work from myself and colleagues at MIT and Georgia Tech&mdash;especially my brilliant friend and collaborator <a href="http://pchvykov.mit.edu/">Pavel Chvykov</a>. In this work, we introduce and validate <u>rattling theory</u>. Here's a short summary of the paper and my contributions:

  <br><br>We routinely witness self-organization in nature: flocking birds, army ant bridges, and molecular motor assemblies, are a few among many examples of natural systems that spontaneously exhibit stunningly ordered behavior. While emergent order at thermal equilibrium is well-understood, general principles underpinning the type of far-from-equilibrium order we observe in living systems have been challenging to identify. Despite these difficulties, in this manuscript we identify a broadly applicable principle capable of predicting and explaining self-organization in the presence of external forcing. In addition to experimentally validating the predictions of the theory, and developing the robotic hardware required to do so, I led efforts to characterize its impact on control of active matter and microrobotic systems. By designing external forcing signals that influence the self-organized configurations of complex systems, there's the potential to push the system into configurations with useful properties, such as those that do work on their environment. This work traces the beginning of a path towards a future where "top-down" control of active collectives is not just possible but convenient&mdash;where ensemble behaviors, rather than microscopically engineered, are self-selected by the choice of external forcing.

<h2>About Me</h2>

  <p style="font-size: 70%">I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Northwestern University <a href="https://robotics.northwestern.edu/">Center for Robotics and Biosystems</a>. I am a member of the <a href="https://murpheylab.github.io/">Interactive and Emergent Autonomy Laboratory</a>, and am advised by <a href="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/profiles/murphey-todd.html">Dr. Todd D. Murphey</a>. I recieved my B.S. in Engineering from <a href="https://www.hmc.edu/">Harvey Mudd College</a> in 2017 and my M.S. in Mechanical Engineering from  <a href="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/mechanical/">Northwestern University</a> in 2020.

  <br><br>I study complex robotic systems and their emergent behaviors. I develop algorithms for identifying and controlling emergence to achieve challenging objectives. My research is at the intersection of robotics, machine learning, information theory, and statistical physics.
