  <p style="font-size: 70%">My latest work has been published in <i>Nature Machine Intelligence</i>! In this paper, I introduce a novel reinforcement learning framework called <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-024-00829-3">Maximum Diffusion Reinforcement Learning</a> (preprint <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15293">here</a>). MaxDiff RL presents a novel decision-making framework built from the ground up to take into account the physical properties of embodied agents during learning and control. MaxDiff RL agents are provably robust, capable of learning in single-shot deployments.

  Here is a video from our paper in which we highlight the robustness of MaxDiff RL agents in comparison to state-of-the-art alternatives.

<h2>About Me</h2>

  <p style="font-size: 70%">I am a Ph.D. candidate and Presidential Fellow at Northwestern University's Center for Robotics and Biosystems. I am a member of the <a href="https://murpheylab.github.io/">Interactive and Emergent Autonomy Laboratory</a>, and am advised by Dr. Todd D. Murphey. I received my B.S. in Engineering from Harvey Mudd College in 2017 and my M.S. in Mechanical Engineering from Northwestern University in 2020.

  <br><br>I am an interdisciplinary scientist and engineer interested in exploring and exploiting the consequences of agent embodiment in robot learning and control across scales. My work combines insights from artificial intelligence, statistical physics, chemical engineering, and materials science to make engineered systems more <i>life-like</i> by exploiting their physical intelligence and emergent capabilities.
